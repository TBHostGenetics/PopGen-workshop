## PopGen Workshop - Imputation ##
## Demonstration ##

# Imputation is the processing of inferring unobserved genotypes in a sample population using a reference panel of known haplotypes from diverse populations. 
# In this demonstration, we will perform imputation through the Sanger Imputation Service, which has been made freely and publicly available by the Wellcome Sanger Institute (https://imputation.sanger.ac.uk).

# Step 1: Convert your QC'd merged PLINK files to Variant Call Format (VCF).
./plink2 --bfile Merged_files_QC --recode vcf --out Merged_files_QC
