## PopGen Workshop - Genotype QC ##
## Demonstration ##

# Take a look at what the PLINK binary files look like
xxd -b Target.bed # The bi-allelic genotype table. Primary representation of genotype calls at biallelic variants.
head Target.bim # Extended variant information file accompanying a .bed binary genotype table.
head Target.fam # Sample information file accompanying a .bed binary genotype table.

# Take a look at how PLINK works
./plink2 --help

Most PLINK runs require exactly one main input fileset. The following flags are available for defining its form and location:
--bfile  <prefix> ['vzs'] : Specify .bed + .bim[.zst] + .fam prefix.

## Genotype QC ##
# Step 1: Remove SNPs with genotype call rate <95%.

# Step 2: Remove individuals missing >10% genotypes.

# Step 3: Remove monomorphic SNPs
# How many individuals are in the file? What is the MAF threshold we need to set? 
# n = 14; maf= 1/2(14) = 1/28 = 0.036

# Step 4: Remove SNPs deviating from HWE p-value = 1.00e-5

 ./plink2 --bfile Target --geno 0.05 --mind 0.1 --maf 0.036 --hwe 0.00001 --make-bed --out Target_QC

## One file has now been QC'd! Now do the Reference file on your own :)
