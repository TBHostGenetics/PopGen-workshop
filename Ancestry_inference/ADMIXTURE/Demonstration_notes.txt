## PopGen Workshop - Ancestry inference using ADMIXTURE ##
## Demonstration ##

In this demonstration, we will show you how to use the ADMIXTURE ancestry inference software to obtain global ancestry proportions for your target samples.

# Step 1: 
ADMIXTURE requires unlinked SNPs in PLINK binary file format. Perform LD-pruning in PLINK on your merged file (i.e. the one following post-imputation QC) using the following parameters - r2 > 0.1 within a 50 SNP sliding window, advanced by 10 SNPs at a time.
