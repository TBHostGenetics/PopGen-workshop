## PopGen Workshop - Local ancestry inference using RFMix ##
## Demonstration ##

# RFMix requires a phased VCF file containing the target individuals and a phased VCF file containing the reference individuals. It also required a genetic map file and a reference sample map file that gives the population label for each reference sample. Examples of the sample map file can be found in this directory.
